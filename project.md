**Proposal Due**: Thursday, October 21, 2021

**Progress Report Due**: Thursday, November 11, 2021

**Final Report Due**: Thursday, December 2, 2021

The project will involve concentrated work in one research project related to data mining. 

* The possible choices of projects will be constrained to those listed below, so there will be several groups working independently on each project.  

* You will not be allowed to propose your own project topic, but each topic leaves enough room to pursue distinct directions so that I expect to see variety among the submissions.  

* I will also be encouraging the use of Piazza for questions/discussions about your project, as well as occasional “town halls” about each project in or immediately after class.    

* While I anticipate that much of the work will be done as the deadline approaches, it is important to get started early enough to discover insurmountable roadblocks in data acquisition or problem definition before it is too late.  

    * The project proposal and progress reports have been instituted to ensure people get serious well in advance of the final deadline.

* Each group will be responsible to turn in **3-5 page project proposals/literature search and progress reports** as of the dates above.  

* I will award almost half of the total grade for each project on the strength of the preliminary reports.  This is to encourage starting early, and to make sure that you and I both know what you are to do before it is too late to avoid trouble. 

* My hope is that the best of the submissions for one or more of these topics will lead to published work.  

    * This has been the case several times when I have taught such a course.  

## Rules of the Game

From past experience, I have found that students tend to herd on a small subset of possible projects. Further, they are irresistibly drawn to poor choices: that offer the least available data, that have limited ways to evaluate success, or little freedom for creativity in modeling.   I have colored the topics I think best in red and marked.  Please consider projects which seem less popular -- likely they will prove better to work on.

Take the time to investigate multiple options during the proposal phase.   You should have gotten some preliminary results by then, enough to provide confidence you will be able to successfully complete the project. 
I reserve the right to reassign the groups with the weakest proposals to other topics for the second phase of the project, both to rescue them from a bad situation and rebalance the class.
A substantial part of the grading of the projects will be done by peers: each student will be charged with grading three other projects on the same topic.   Part of your grade for the course will be a function of how seriously you take this, e.g the quality of your feedback.   Peer review is how research papers are selected for publication, and I hope this will be revealing.  I am hoping that this review will provide insights to improve your own projects as well.
To preserve anonymity in submissions, it is important that the papers you submit online for grading not contain your names or ID numbers.    Indeed, the peer grading form/rubric will include a question if the grader can figure out whose paper they have, and if so we will take off points.
Expect to be asked to do a trial peer grading exercise to test our system soon.   Please respond promptly.
Group sizes should usually range from two to three students.   The amount of work per group is expected to scale linearly with the effort involved.    The projects are large enough that I do not think students working by themselves can achieve the critical mass to get a substantial project done, and are strongly discouraged.
Each student will be asked to proportion their group’s effort among all the team members they are working with.   So make sure you work with people who you like, trust, and respect.
I will possibly add another few projects later, so check back occasionally.
