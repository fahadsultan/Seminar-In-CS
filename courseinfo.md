## Course Description 

This is a seminal course in the Computer Science and Information Technology curriculum. It is designed to provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired in their previous courses to a significant project. The course is also intended to provide students with the opportunity to develop their technical communication and comprehensions skills, both written and oral. The course is a required course for all Computer Science and Information Technology majors.

The course has three major components:

1. A significant project that is completed by each individual student. The project is intended to be a significant software development project that requires the students to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired in their previous courses. 

2. A series of lectures and discussions on topics related to the project. These topics include project management, software engineering, ethics, and professional development.

3. Purposeful Pathways events that are designed to help students develop their professional skills. These events include workshops on resume writing, interviewing, and networking.


## Course Goals

> _You must master three things to “selling” new ideas:_
> 
> 1. _Giving formal presentations_
> 2. _Producing written reports, and_
> 3. _Mastering the art of informal presentations as they happen to occur._
> 
> _All three are essential—you must learn to sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by force of clear presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists and others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be carefully presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be rediscovered because it was not well presented the first time, years before!_
