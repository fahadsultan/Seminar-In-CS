## Course Description 

> _You must master three things to “selling” new ideas:_
> 
> 1. _Giving formal presentations_
> 2. _Producing written reports, and_
> 3. _Mastering the art of informal presentations as they happen to occur._
> 
> _All three are essential—you must learn to sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by force of clear presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists and others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be carefully presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be rediscovered because it was not well presented the first time, years before!_
