<h2>Handing in Assignments</h2>

All assignments will be handed in electronically in Word or .pdf format on Moodle. Files must
be submitted on Moodle 5 minutes PRIOR to class on the day they are due. Note the electronic
submission has a timestamp to indicate your submission is on time. Remember discussion
questions should also be emailed to the discussion leaders and me. If you complete an
application as part of your term project, you must also submit your code, with instructions for
compiling and running, (as a .zip file) by our final exam slot.
