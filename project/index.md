In this course, you will plan, execute, and present the results of a term-long project of your choosing. If you are an Information Technology major, your project must relate to your cognate discipline. 

In the project, _**you will be asking a question and defending an argument in a Final Paper, in [Class Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y4OMQq9ChapHJF-cUaYQa6J7IUvhlgL5Z-AJ8MRbJis/edit?usp=sharing), and [Poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12WyL8m-YKPqiJ7r9GkSo76Du0YdzAppPeT3xjPy1yj0/edit?usp=sharing) at Furman Engaged.**_

In addition to our seminar discussions, many class sessions will be devoted to instruction on planning, executing, and presenting your project. 

The steps of your project are to mirror the steps of the scientific method:

1. **Identify a question** that you want to answer. [Project Preproposal]()**Due September 15**{: .label .label-red }

2. **Identify a data set (evidence)** that will help you answer the question. [Project Proposal]()**Due September 15**{: .label .label-red }

3. **[Conduct a literature search]()** to see what others have done. **Due October 1**{: .label .label-red }
4. **Identify a model (hypothesis)** that will help you answer the question. **Due November 1**{: .label .label-red }
5. **Analyze the results** using the model and data. **Due November 15**{: .label .label-red }
6. **Draw conclusions** from the results. **Due December 1**{: .label .label-red }
7. **Presentation** of your findings **Last two weeks of class**{: .label .label-red }

{: .notice }
You might want to start by identifying a data set to ground your question.

<!-- 
* Each student will be responsible to turn in **3-5 page project proposals/literature search and progress reports** as of the dates above.   -->

<!-- 
Your project will likely take one of three forms: 

1. Conduct an extensive and systematic literature review on a particular topic in computer science.
2. Create an application.
3. Data Analysis project. 

Note that an application need not be robust, but must be sufficiently functional to illustrate your argument.  -->

<!-- 1. What is the problem you are trying to solve?
2. Why is it important?
3. Why is it challenging?
4. What is the data you are using?
5. What is the model you are using?
6. What are the results?
8. What are the conclusions? -->


**Peer Grading**: A substantial part of the grading of the projects will be done by peers: each student will be charged with grading three other projects on the same topic. _Peer review is how research papers are selected for publication in academia_, and I hope this will be revealing.  I am hoping that this review will provide insights to improve your own projects as well.

~~To preserve **anonymity in submissions**, it is important that the papers you submit online for grading **not contain your names** or ID numbers. Indeed, the peer grading form/rubric will include a question if the grader can figure out whose paper they have, and if so we will take off points.~~

**Your project code should be on [Github](https://github.com) and your manuscript should be on [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).** See links below for more details.
