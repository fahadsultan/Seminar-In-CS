## LaTeX

<br/>


You are expected to use LaTeX for your final report. You can use any Latex editor you like. I recommend [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). It is free and easy to use. You can also use [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/).

## LaTeX Template

Your final report should be in the [IEEE Conference Template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Overleaf version of the template can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn).

Your report should be at least 4 pages long. You can use the following sections in your report:

* Introduction
* Related Work
* Data
* Methods
* Results
* Conclusion
