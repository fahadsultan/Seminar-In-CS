The computer science seminar is the capstone experience for CS and IT majors that includes:

1. Students-led Discussions on Assigned reading of the week (starting week 3)
2. Term-long Capstone Project

## Students-led Discussions on Assigned reading of the week (starting week 3)
The seminar discussion sessions have been broken into three units: 
1. Fundamental Computer Science Questions
2. Computer Science Breadth
3. Computer Science in Depth Case Study: Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

The goal is to engage you with all aspects of Computer Science including seminal research, broad research areas, and in-depth topics in one research area.

**Each class has assigned readings that will be read by all class participants**

Individuals or groups will lead a discussion on the readings. My role as instructor is to participate as a member of the seminar and provide guidance on how to lead a class discussion, both before class and during class.

### Successful class discussions

Successful class discussions are not simply a summary of the readings. Instead, you should prepare to lead a discussion that will:
#### 1.1. Establish common ground.
Your classmates should all be prepared to discuss the assigned readings, so you should not summarize the readings! However, you may want to ask questions about the reading, or emphasize some important points to draw everyone’s attentions to the parts of the reading that will support the class discussion.
#### 1.2. Expand knowledge.
To prepare for class, you must do additional research on the topic of your articles. For example, you can look up some of the literature cited by your readings so you can provide some additional background information. The majority of the papers you will be reading are “seminal” papers, meaning they strongly influenced later developments. You should make the class aware of some of the research that developed out of your articles. One way to find these developments is to do a search for articles that cite your article (e.g., the “Cited by” tab in the ACM digital library).

#### 1.3. Ask discussion questions
Come prepared with a list of discussion questions, and select appropriate questions to guide an interesting discussion.

### Responsibilities
Your responsibilities include:
#### Leading discussions

You will lead two class discussions, approximately 60 minutes in length; one will be led with a partner or group – I will make every effort to ensure your first class discussion is not individual.

PowerPoint slides (or other multimedia) are optional; if necessary, bring your own computer or make arrangements with me at least 24 hours in advance to use a computer.

I encourage you to meet with me in office hours to discuss the three aspects of your class discussion.

Your topics (and date of presentations) will be assigned by the second class. You have 24 hours from the end of the first class to look over the list of topics and send me a ranking of your top five topics you would be interested in presenting and two topics you would prefer not present. Your preferences will be taken into consideration, but cannot be guaranteed.

Note, all class participants will be submitting questions prior to your class discussion (see below). You can use these questions throughout your discussion. However, do not wait for these questions to start preparing! Your class discussion will require careful reading of the article, background research, and critical thought. By the time you receive the questions, you should be using them to “polish” your plan.

You are required to submit a summary of notes for your discussion, including a minimum of three references in Chicago format. Your notes should be divided into three sections: establish common ground, expand knowledge, and discussion questions. 

In addition to submitting your notes on Moodle, you should either bring a hard copy for me to class OR email me your notes 1 hour before class.

I will post Furman email addresses for discussion leaders to Moodle so class participants can submit questions (see below). Please check your Furman email for questions. If you would prefer your email not be posted to Moodle, please let me know ASAP. Students will send questions to me, and I will forward them to you.
#### Participation
Participating in class discussions is a critical component of the course and comprised of preparation, attendance, and active participation.

##### Preparation
For each class session, you will prepare by submitting article reflection(s) for each of the assigned readings for the seminar sessions. Write a half-page reflection on each article:

1. What is the authors’ main argument.
2. What kinds of evidence do they use to make that argument?
3. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article?

Your reflection may be brief (it doesn’t even need to be complete sentences), but must demonstrate you reflected on the argument of the paper.

Write 3 questions you have after reading the articles. You may not write all 3 questions on the same article. Your 3 questions must be emailed to me and the class discussion leaders as agreed upon in class and indicated on the Moodle schedule. Discussion leaders may use the questions to supplement their discussion, or I may draw attention to some questions during class.

Reflections and questions should also be submitted as a Word or .pdf file on Moodle. See handing in materials, below. Please also bring a hard copy for your reference during class.

##### Class attendance

Please discuss any necessary absences with me (see attendance policy below).

##### Active Participation

Thoughtful contributions to the discussions will also be part of your class participation grade

## Capstone Project

For your capstone project, you will plan, execute, and present the results of a term-long project of your choosing. If you are an Information Technology major, your project must relate to your cognate discipline. Your project will likely take one of two forms:

3.1.  You can conduct a literature review on a particular topic in computer science.

3.2.  You can create an application, for example by implementing an algorithm or functional prototype from a research paper and applying a new idea to the implementation (extension, applying it to a new context, etc.).

Other formats are possible. Meet with me to discuss ideas. Projects involving human participants will require approval from Furman’s IRB.

In any case, you will conduct background research on your topic, though a literature review will require more extensive and systematic literature research than an application. In both cases, you will be asking a question and defending an argument in a final paper, in class presentation, and poster at Furman Engaged. For a literature review, your evidence will come from the literature; for an application, your primary evidence will come from the results of your application. Note that an application need not be robust, but must be sufficiently functional to illustrate your argument. In addition to our seminar discussions, many class sessions will be devoted to instruction on planning, executing, and presenting your project.

### Milestones
<p>The project includes required components and milestones:</p>
<p>a) Topic selection – due: Thursday, January 30</p>

<h2>Handing in Assignments</h2>

All assignments will be handed in electronically in Word or .pdf format on Moodle. Files must
be submitted on Moodle 5 minutes PRIOR to class on the day they are due. Note the electronic
submission has a timestamp to indicate your submission is on time. Remember discussion
questions should also be emailed to the discussion leaders and me. If you complete an
application as part of your term project, you must also submit your code, with instructions for
compiling and running, (as a .zip file) by our final exam slot.


## Pre-requisites

* CSC-121 Introduction to Computer Programming

## Fulfills requirements

* Core course requirement for Data Analytics minor
* Human Behavior GER

## Course Description

This is an introductory course that aims to teach the fundamentals of Data Mining, focusing broadly on:

* Programming for Data Science
* Unsupervised Learning
* Supervised Learning
* Ethical considerations in Data Mining

## Course Goals
<!-- 
* Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques

* Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems -->

On successful completion of the course, the students should have the ability to identify and apply appropriate data mining and/or machine learning techniques towards solving problems of pattern recogition, learning and prediction. The course also aims to instill in students a deep sensitivity of issues of algorithmic bias and fairness in data mining.
